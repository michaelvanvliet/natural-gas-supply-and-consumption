The impact in the Netherlands, as in many other countries, is huge and therefore a good subject to use for a new data science project! We will be exploring historic data to try and understand what is happening and try to explain what decisions and changes have led to where we are now.\n","\n","## DATA\n","In the Netherlands we have the Central Bureau of Statistics ([CBS](https://www.cbs.nl)). They provide insights into many topics such as unemployment rates, greenhouse gas emissions, inflation, house pricing, supply and demand of natural gas, and many more. In addition to writing very informative articles (based on facts), they also give open access to the data used for the articles, such as this one: [Natural gas consumption 25 percent lower in first half of 2022](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2022/35/natural-gas-consumption-25-percent-lower-in-first-half-of-2022) ([link to data](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=en&_catalog=CBS&tableId=00372eng&_theme=1053)).\n","\n","## TOOLS\n","For this project we will be making use of [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [many more](https://pypi.org/).
